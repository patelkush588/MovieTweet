# MovieTweet
Sentiment Analysis means classification of a text or a sentence according to their overall positivity or negativity. Here, we analyze 
sentiments of tweets of movie to derive the rating and review of the movie on the box office. We also form clusters using unsupervised 
algorithm to classify the tweets of the movie. We also propose a recommendation module for the movies using association rule mining.

Here, we proposed a model which works on the user reviews of the movie which are then combined, and a conclusion is brought. This 
conclusion about the user review is brought using sentiment analysis of the tweets and combining all the sentiment analysis of a movie. 
This conclusion is mapped to integer value and a movie is rated on a scale of 0 to 5. A statistical diagram can also be obtained which 
shows positive,negative and neutral responses on the movie in percentage value. A visual representation of the reviews of the movie is 
done using wordcloud.
